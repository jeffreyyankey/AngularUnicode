# AngularUnicode
This is the new version of the SATTS Unicode project originally done in PERL.

Angular version uses SQL/PHP to call in a table and create a JSON object that converts Romanized text and symbols into other languages using Unicode. Some servers cannot handle foreign language text so unicode can be used instead. The browser interprets the unicode  characters into the localized language text.
